			The program to retrieve and process the data is written in Python. To scrape the data, we used the Python libraries Twython, Praw, and BeautifulSoup to access the Twitter, Reddit, and Wikipedia APIs, respectively. The webpage was designed using HTML/CSS, and put together using the Django framework. This web application is hosted on the Heroku platform.
